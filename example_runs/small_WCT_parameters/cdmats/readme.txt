This folder contains 3 replicates of two different model scenarios.

Model 1 is the riverine scenario with no handling mortality associated with electrofishing.

Model 2 is the barrier scenario with no handling mortality associated with electrofishing.

Model 3 is the natanthro barrier scenario with standard Pareto movement. This scenario is to test whether increasing the amount of barriers will result in different genetic metrics over time than the riverine distance scenario.

Model 4 is a riverine scenario where movement is dictated by the distribution of the cost distances themselves, with no threshold on movement. This should result in much higher rates of movement.

These simulations are meant to be pilot simulations. In other words, these sims will provide a good opportunity for developing and testing analyses, and also testing the simulations to make sure they're operating as expected prior to running the full suite of sims.
